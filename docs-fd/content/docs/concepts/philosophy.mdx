description: libmodulor offers flexible primitives to build apps faster, without boilerplates. Use any stack DB, frontend, server, tools & moreâ€”your choice !

One might argue that, with so many "JS frameworks" on the market, there are already too many ways to build new applications today. And they would be right.

That's why the angle taken by `libmodulor` is different. Although opinionated about some things (see below), it is not, regarding the technical side. Instead, it focuses mainly on the "core" of your application.

Thus, you are free to use :

- the data store of your choice (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, DynamoDB, SQLite, MongoDB...),
- the frontend framework of your choice (React, Svelte, Angular, Vue, Solid...),
- the server of your choice (Express, Fastify, Hono...),
- the meta framework of your choice (Next, Remix, Astro, Nuxt...),
- the runtime of your choice (Node, Deno, Bun...)
- the libraries of your choice (Lodash, React Query...)
- the tools of your choice (Biome, ESLint, Prettier...)
- the styling library of your choice for web (tailwind, shadcn, bootstrap, vanilla CSS...)
- the hosting of your choice (Cloud, IaaS, PaaS, On-Prem, RaspberryPi, your fridge...)

The main goal is to offer higher level primitives that make building business applications faster, without having to use a boilerplate or worse, no/low code, and thus, avoid vendor lock-in.
