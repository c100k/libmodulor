title: Dependency Injection (DI)
description: libmodulor uses Dependency Injection to stay platform-agnostic. Apps run anywhere by injecting interfaces, avoiding platform-specific dependencies.
---

`libmodulor` relies heavily on [Dependency Injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) because of its **platform-agnostic** nature :

> Apps must be runnable anywhere

Therefore, most primitives are based on `injectable` classes that `inject` their dependencies.

Anywhere you see `injectable` in the upcoming guides (`UCMain`, `UCPolicy`, etc.), you are required to respect the following rule :

> Injectables must inject only interfaces and/or classes that are platform-agnostic.

For instance, you should never have `node:*`, `react-native-*` or similar imports in an app as this would break this rule.
For the same reason, even though they are called "Web Standards", you should never use them directly neither, as they are not available on all runtimes.

Instead, you should describe the behavior in an interface and create concrete implementations.
Interfaces are injected in your use cases and concrete implementations are bound in the DI container at the target level.

As an example, calling a file system is inherently platform specific.
The following interface defines the contract.
It can be safely `injected` in any `injectable`.

```typescript
interface FileManager {
    readFile(): Promise<string>;
}

// Usage
@inject('FileManager') private fileManager: FileManager;
```

On the other side, these implementations are platform-agnostic by nature. 

```typescript
class NodeFileManager implements FileManager {
    // Uses https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html
}
class ReactNativeFileManager implements FileManager {
    // Uses https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dr.pogodin/react-native-fs
}
class BunFileManager implements FileManager {
    // Uses https://bun.sh/docs/api/file-io
}
class WebFileManager implements FileManager {
    // Uses nothing OR you can implement a virtual FS for web based environments
}

// Usage
container.bind<FileManager>('FileManager').to(NodeFileManager);
```
