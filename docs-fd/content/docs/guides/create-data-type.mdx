title: Create a data type
description: Use cases define input/output using specific data types.

## Intro

A data type is a class that extends the `TBase` class directly or indirectly.

`libmodulor` provides [data types](../references/data-types) that are commonly used in apps.
But in some cases, your apps need specific data types.

## Example

As an example, defining an [ISIN](https://www.isin.org) as a `string` is too approximative.
Indeed, it has a specific length, format, etc.

Thus the need to introduce specific data types in some apps.

```typescript title="TISIN.ts"
export type ISIN = Capitalize<string>;

export class TISIN extends TString<ISIN, 'ISIN'> {
    public static readonly FORMAT: RegExp = /^[A-Z]{2}[A-Z0-9]{9}[0-9]$/;

    constructor(constraints?: TStringConstraints) {
        super({
            ...constraints,
            format: { f: 'ISIN', regexp: TISIN.FORMAT },
        });
    }

    public override tName(): TName {
        return 'ISIN';
    }

    public override example(): ISIN {
        return 'US02079K3059';
    }
}
```

It defines two things that need to be exported :

- A type (e.g. `ISIN` that specifies the data type with a TypeScript type)
- A class (e.g. `TISIN` that specifies how the data type behaves)

`libmodulor` provides [a set of "primitive"](https://github.com/c100k/libmodulor/tree/master/dist/esm/dt/base) data types that you can extend.

Note in the example above how we've defined a `format` for the ISIN, based on the spec.
This provides the `validation_format_ISIN` translation key that you can use in [Translate an app](./translate-app).
