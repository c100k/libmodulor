title: Create a product
description: A product is a logical group of apps that are assembled together. It's simply what end users know and use.
---

Its logical representation is a directory named `src/products/{AppName}` that has the following structure :

```sh
üìÅ target1
üìÅ ...
üìÅ targetn
üìÑ i18n.ts
üìÑ manifest.ts
```

## target1 .. targetn

Each directory corresponds to a target exposing the product.

If the product is supported by a webapp and a mobile app, there will typically be `server`, `web`, `rn` directories (or similar).

Check [Expose a target](./expose-target) for more details.

## manifest

It's a file named `manifest.ts` exporting a const named `Manifest` that must satisfy the `ProductManifest` interface.

```typescript
export const Manifest: ProductManifest = {
    appReg: [{ name: 'Trading' }],
    name: 'SuperTrader',
};
```

`appReg` stands of "app registry". It lists all the apps the product uses.
It provides an optional `ucds.exclude` property in order to exclude some use cases for being mounted.
This is particularly useful when you have a generic app (e.g. `Auth`) providing a large range of use cases,
but some products don't need all of them.

`name` must be the same as the product directory name.

## i18n

It's a file named `i18n.ts` exporting a const named `I18n` that must satisfy the `ProductI18n` interface.

Unlike the app `i18n`, this one gives you more freedom to define translation keys.

```typescript
import { I18nEN } from 'libmodulor/locales/en';

import { I18n as TradingI18n } from '../../apps/Trading/index.js';

export const I18n: ProductI18n = {
    en: {
        ...I18nEN,
        ...TradingI18n.en,
        p_desc: 'A simple app to trade crypto, shares and other assets',
        p_slogan: 'Trading made simple',
    },
};
```

Note how we include the `i18n` of :

- the library (`I18nEN`) to provide basic translations of exposed primitives
- the apps (`TradingI18n`) to provide apps translations
