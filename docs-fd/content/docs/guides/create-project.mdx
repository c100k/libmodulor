title: Create a project
description: libmodulor can be used in a brownfield project but we recommend starting a greenfield project to enjoy the full expressiveness and convention system.

## With npx

```sh
npx libmodulor CreateProject --projectName my-super-project
```

By default, it will create a folder named `my-super-project` in the current working directory and install the dependencies using `pnpm`.

If you want to change the defaults (initial commit, pkg manager, etc.), run the `--help` command.

```sh
npx libmodulor --help | grep CreateProject -C 10
```

Execution should take a few seconds and give the following output.

```sh
Need to install the following packages:
libmodulor@latest
Ok to proceed? (y) y

```

The generated directory has the following structure :

```sh
📁 src
    📁 apps # the apps of the project (empty for now)
    📁 products # the products of the project (empty for now)
📄 .gitignore # includes the files/dirs patterns to exclude from version control
📄 biome.json # config for the linter (feel free to change it if you don't like the defaults and run pnpm lint again)
📄 package.json # main config file containing info, scripts and dependencies
📄 README.md # main documentation file (feel free to enhance it with explanations about the purpose of your project)
📄 tsconfig.json # config file for TypeScript (pretty strict by default)
📄 vitest.config.ts # config file for Vitest, the test runner
```

Optionally, you can create a remote repository (e.g. on GitHub) and push it.

## Manually

If you don't like the magic behind `npx`, or if you want to add `libmodulor` to an existing project, you can install it manually.

Check the required dependencies in [package.json](https://github.com/c100k/libmodulor/blob/master/dist/esm/apps/Helper/src/lib/project.js#L29).
