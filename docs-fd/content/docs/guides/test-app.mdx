title: Test an app
description: libmodulor provides a full mechanism to automatically test the use cases of an app.
---

`libmodulor` relies on [vitest](https://vitest.dev) to run the tests and [@vitest/coverage-v8](https://vitest.dev/guide/coverage) for the coverage.

## Configurator

By default, no tests are executed for an app. First, create a file named `src/apps/{AppName}/test/Configurator.ts`.

```typescript
@injectable()
export class Configurator extends SimpleAppTesterConfigurator {}
```

Generate the automated tests for the app.

```sh
yarn libmodulor GenerateAppsTests
```

Run the tests.

```sh
yarn libmodulor TestApp --appName {AppName}
```

```sh

In addition to running the tests, it also :

- Generates a coverage reports : `src/apps/{AppName}/test/reports/coverage/index.html`
- Generates a test scenarios report : `src/apps/{AppName}/test/reports/simple-html/index.html`
- Update the app's README : `src/apps/{AppName}/README.md`

## Coverage report

This is a regular coverage report generated by `@vitest/coverage-v8`.

## Test scenarios report

This is generated by `libmodulor` providing you an HTML file containing table listing all the scenarios tested.

## README.md

This is generated by `libmodulor` providing an overview of the app with :

- a sequence diagram for each use case
- a technical summary for all the use cases

It gives a great overview of what the app does.

In [Create a use case](./create-use-case), we mentioned comments starting with `// >=> `.
This is where they enter in action. These comments are displayed in an awesome way in the sequence diragram,
giving an overview on what's going on in the "use case box".

## Customize

The `Configurator` class offers a basic setup.
But in most advanced apps, it needs to be customized to handle more complex scenarios.
It offers methods that can be overriden to achieve this goal.

### Auth setters

By default, each use case is tested for multiple auth settings (anonymous, authenticated, etc.).
You can override this behavior by providing your own.

### Implementations

By default, the IoC `container` used, binds basic implementations. You can bind additional interfaces or rebind some of them.

### Clearing

In case your use cases create some side effects that can impact others, you can clear the execution.

### Flows

Use cases are automatically tested in isolation. You can create flows to test a list of use cases one after the other to simulate a real user behavior.

For instance, for an `Auth` app, you can test the following flow : `SignUp` > `SignIn` > `SignOut`.

### Input fillers

When testing, the use cases are filled data computed from the data types. You can add more inputs by overriding this.

### Options

Override the default options used by the test runner.

### Seed

Fill your data stores with basic data in case your use cases need them (e.g. some enum data in some data store).

### Side effects

For example, your use cases can send emails. These are considered side effects you can control here.

### Specific assertions

By default, the tests are asserted via snapshots. But sometimes, use cases return different data at each execution by nature (e.g. a timestamp).

Although we recommended making the tests deterministic by using `Fake*` implementations, sometimes it's not possible or not acceptable.

In this case, you can override the snapshot assertion by a specific one using the `hash` of the test execution to identify it.
