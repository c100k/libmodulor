title: Create an app
description: An app is a logical group of use cases. It's like a "module" (_whatever that means_), inspired by Domain-driven design (DDD) bounded contexts.
---

Its logical representation is a directory named `src/apps/{AppName}` that has the following structure :

```sh
📁 src
    📁 dt # custom data types
    📁 lib # types, interfaces, classes, functions, consts... used across multiple use cases
    📁 ucds # the use case definitions
    📄 i18n.ts
    📄 manifest.ts
📄 index.ts
```

## manifest

It's a file named `manifest.ts` exporting a const named `Manifest` that must satisfy the `AppManifest` interface.

```typescript
import type { AppManifest } from 'libmodulor';

export const Manifest = {
    languageCodes: ['en'],
    name: 'Trading',
    ucReg: {},
} satisfies AppManifest;
```

The `languageCodes` property lists all the [country codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) that the app supports.
Note that for any language listed here, `i18n` (see below), must contain the corresponding translation key.

The `name` must be the same as the app directory name.

`ucReg` stands for "use case registry". It lists all the use cases metadata of the app. Check out [Create a use case](./create-use-case) for more details.

## i18n

It's a file named `i18n.ts` exporting a const named `I18n` that must satisfy the `AppI18n` interface.

```typescript
import type { AppI18n } from 'libmodulor';

export const I18n: AppI18n = {
    en: {},
};
```

It contains translations for the common things that can be translated in the app. Check out [Translate an app](./translate-app) for more details.

<Callout>
    You can leave translations empty and things will still work.
    In this case, the library will `humanize` the fields.
    Although it can work in some cases, it's not ideal in terms of UX.
</Callout>

## index

It's a barrel file exporting only what's consumed outside the app (typically `i18n`, `manifest` and some use case defs).


```typescript
// Expose only what's necessary

export { I18n } from './src/i18n.js';
export { Manifest } from './src/manifest.js';
```
