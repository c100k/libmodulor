title: Create an app
description: An app is a logical group of use cases. It's like a "module" (whatever that means), inspired by Domain-driven design (DDD) bounded contexts.
---

Its logical representation is a directory named `src/apps/{AppName}` that has the following structure :

```sh
📁 src
    📁 dt
    📁 lib
    📁 policies
    📁 ucds
    📄 i18n.ts
    📄 manifest.ts
📁 test
📄 index.ts
```

## dt

This folder contains the custom data types of the app. Check [Create a data type](./create-data-type) for more details.

## lib

This folder contains types, interfaces, classes, functions, consts... used across multiple use cases.

These are typically related to the purpose of the app. Typically, an app that sends stuff would have a `Sender` interface with some implementations.

## policies

This folder contains the custom policies of the app. Check [Create a policy](./create-policy) for more details.

## ucds

This folder contains the use case definitions of the app. Check [Create a use case](./create-use-case) for more details.

## manifest

It's a file named `manifest.ts` exporting a const named `Manifest` that must satisfy the `AppManifest` interface.

```typescript title="src/manifest.ts"
import type { AppManifest } from 'libmodulor';

export const Manifest = {
    languageCodes: ['en'],
    name: 'Trading',
    ucReg: {},
} satisfies AppManifest;
```

`languageCodes` lists all the [country codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) that the app supports.
For any language listed here, `i18n` (see below), must contain the corresponding entry.

`name` must be the same as the app directory name.

`ucReg` stands for "use case registry". It lists all the use cases of the app. Check out [Create a use case](./create-use-case) for more details.

## i18n

It's a file named `i18n.ts` exporting a const named `I18n` that must satisfy the `AppI18n` interface.

```typescript title="src/i18n.ts"
import type { AppI18n } from 'libmodulor';

export const I18n: AppI18n = {
    en: {},
};
```

It contains translations for the common things that can be translated in the app. Check out [Translate an app](./translate-app) for more details.

<Callout>
    You can leave translations empty and things will still work.
    In this case, the library will `humanize` the fields.
    Although it can work in some cases, it's not ideal in terms of UX.
</Callout>

## index

It's a barrel file exporting only what's consumed outside the app (typically `i18n`, `manifest` and some use case defs).

```typescript title="index.ts"
// Expose only what's necessary

export { I18n } from './src/i18n.js';
export { Manifest } from './src/manifest.js';
```

## test

Check [Test an app](./test-app) for more details.
