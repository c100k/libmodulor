description: libmodulor provides data types that are commonly used in apps.

## Base

[Base data types](https://github.com/c100k/libmodulor/tree/master/dist/esm/dt/base) are "generic".
Except in some cases, we don't recommend using them directly in use cases as they lack semantic meaning.
Instead, you should extend them to create "final" data types.

## Final

[Final data types](https://github.com/c100k/libmodulor/tree/master/dist/esm/dt/final) represent real life notions.
They extend directly or indirectly base data types.

This list is naturally not exhaustive and data types are regularly created to fit new use cases.
