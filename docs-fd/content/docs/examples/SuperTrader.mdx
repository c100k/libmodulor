```

### mcp-server

The `mcp-server` target uses the built-in `node-mcp-server` target, is transpiled with `tsc` and exposes an `index.js` file to be used by the MCP client.

Test in [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download).

Register the MCP server by copy/pasting the following config, adapting the absolute path with `pwd`.

```sh
nano ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "libmodulor-supertrader": {
            "command": "node",
            "args": [
                "/ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_THE_CWD/dist/products/SuperTrader/mcp-server/index.js"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

Launch Claude Desktop.

At the bottom right of the prompt you should see a little hammer üî® indicating `1 MCP Tool available`.

Click on it. You should see the `Trading_BuyAsset` use case registered.

Write a prompt to buy an asset.
