description: Examples of use cases embedded directly in the page

The [Basic](./Basic) and [SuperTrader](./SuperTrader) examples show how to integrate `libmodulor` in dedicated projects.
But it can also be used anywhere. As an example, you can find below multiple use cases that are embedded directly in this page (Next.js + React), using the exact same mechanisms.

Some use cases require an API key. You can safely use yours as all the calls are between your browser and the desginated service (e.g. Mistral or Asana).
The API calls do not reach our servers whatsoever. You can confirm it by checking the "Network" tab of your browser developer panel.
