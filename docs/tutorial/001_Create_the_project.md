Open the generated directory with your favorite editor and start browsing the files to get an overview of the structure. Here is an explanation of what each one does :

- `src/apps` : contains the `apps` of your project (empty for now)
- `src/products` : contains the `products` of your project (empty for now)
- `.gitignore` : includes the files/dirs patterns to exclude from version control
- `biome.json` : config for the linter (feel free to change it if you don't like the defaults)
- `package.json` : main config file containing info, scripts and dependencies
- `README.md` : main documentation file (feel free to enhance it with explanations about the purpose of your application)
- `tsconfig.json` : config file for TypeScript (pretty strict by default)
- `vitest.config.ts` : config file for Vitest, the test runner

Optionally, you can create a remote repository (e.g. on GitHub) and push it.

Now that's done, let's [Create the App](./002_Create_the_App.md).
