# (BONUS) Expose the rn Target

We'll use the pre-built [React Native](https://reactnative.dev) components with [Expo](https://github.com/expo/expo).

> [!WARNING]
> Like in the `web` Target, there won't be any particular style so we can focus only on the semantics. Feel free to add some if you want to.
