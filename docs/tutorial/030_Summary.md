# Summary

That was cool ! In a couple of minutes we have created the foundations of a multi-platform application.

And we have only touched the surface as `libmodulor` has much more to offer.

We have used the "pre-built" targets, but it's totally possible to do the same with a Hono server, a stricli CLI, a Vue.js SPA and so on. All the targets implement generic interfaces provided by `libmodulor`, making the whole thing fully modular.
