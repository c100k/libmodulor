# Define wording for humans

By default, the UI simply "humanizes" the use case field keys. It's fine for technical people, but not for humans.

Update `src/apps/Trading/src/i18n.ts` and add the following keys to `en`.

```typescript
        uc_BuyAsset_label: 'Buy an asset',
        uc_BuyAsset_i_submit_idle: 'Send buy order',
        uc_BuyAsset_i_submit_submitting: 'Sending',
        ucif_isin_label: 'ISIN',
        ucif_qty_label: 'Quantity',
        ucof_executedDirectly_label: 'ðŸš€ Executed directly',
        ucof_id_label: 'Identifier',
        validation_format_ISIN:
            'Must be 2 uppercase letters, followed by 9 alphanumeric characters and 1 digit',
```

Update `src/products/SuperTrader/i18n.ts` and add the following keys to `en`.

```typescript
total: 'Total',
```

> [!NOTE]
> We distinguish what's related to the app from what's related to the product. Usually, in the app's `i18n`, you'll add only translations following a certain convention like `dt_*` (data type choices), `err_*` (error messages), `uc_*` (use cases), `ucif_*` (use case input fields), `ucof_*` (use case output fields), `validation_*` (validation messages), etc.

Press <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> to stop the server.

```sh
yarn build && yarn run:server
```

Refresh the page. You should see a better wording. Try to type an invalid `ISIN` and see how the full validation message is displayed as well.

Now run the tests.

```sh
yarn test
```

They should fail. But for expected reasons. Since we've changed the wording, some error messages have changed as well.

Run the tests again, updating the snapshots.

```sh
yarn test -u
```

They should now pass.

```sh
yarn lint && yarn test && git add . && git commit -m "feat: define wording for humans"
```

Now that's done, let's [Expose the cli Target](./010_Expose_the_cli_Target.md).
