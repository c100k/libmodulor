A TypeScript library to create platform-agnostic applications.

> [!WARNING]
> The project is still in active development. Although already used in pilot projects, it's not suitable for all production scenarios yet.
> Being developed by only one person, it may keep going for years or stop at any time.
> In the meantime, it's still a "research project" that needs improvement. Thus, it will be subject to BREAKING CHANGES as long as the version is not `1.0.0`.
> All that said, the end goal is really to have a **production-grade library** to help everyone build **quality projects faster**.
