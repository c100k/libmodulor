An opinionated TypeScript library to create business oriented applications.

Applications created with `libmodulor` have **6 main properties** :

- Strictly typed with explicit business data types
- Fully typed e2e without code generation
- Auto documented
- Auto tested
- Multi platforms/runtimes
- Runnable anywhere

> [!WARNING]
> The project is still in active development. Although already used in pilot projects, it's not suitable for all production scenarios yet.
> Being developed by only one person, it may keep going for years or stop at any time.
> In the meantime, it's still a "research project" that needs improvement. Thus, it will be subject to BREAKING CHANGES as long as the version is not `1.0.0`.
> All that said, the end goal is really to have a **production-grade library** to help everyone build **quality projects faster**. If you want to help in any way or have questions, feel free to contact me (cf. `author` in `package.json`).

> [!NOTE]
> At the beginning, the whole documentation will be on GitHub, starting from this file, to make it easier to have the big picture, maintain and <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd>. At some point, I'll consider having a beautiful documentation website like all the cool kids.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started, we recommend reading the [📖 Introduction](./docs/Introduction.md) first. It will give you an overview of what `libmodulor` is and how it works.

Then, you can follow the [🚀 Tutorial](./docs/Tutorial.md) that will show you all the main notions by building something real. We'll build a small Trading app that will allow us to buy an asset from a web page, a Terminal, Claude Desktop, Android and iOS ! All within a single, simple codebase.

Finally, for more advanced usages, go to the [📜 Guides](./docs/Guides.md).
